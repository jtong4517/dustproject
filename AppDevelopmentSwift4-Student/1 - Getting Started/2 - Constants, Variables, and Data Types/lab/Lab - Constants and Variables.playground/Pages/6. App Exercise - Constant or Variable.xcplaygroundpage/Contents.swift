 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Bob"
print("The name of the user will most likely never change.")
var age = 42
print("Age increases over time.")
var stepsTakenToday = 0
print("The number of steps taken will increase over the lifetime of the program.")
let goalSteps = 10000
print("The user's goal is preset.")
var averageHeartRate = 100
print("Because the average heart rate is measured over the last 24 hours, the value will change.")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
